* Changes in P4::C4 2.000 8/08/2002

**	First CPAN Release

**	Changes relative to C4-1.6 C program by Neil Russell

***	The .c4 file is now named .p4config
	as the p4 program knows how to use a .p4config file.

***	The .c4ignore file is now named .cvsignore
	to allow direct importing/exporting to/from CVS.

***	Multiple and single-file arguments allowed with the update command.

***	Client-create command added.

***	The API is used, rather then calling p4
	This improves the speed of the program.

***	A cache of file modification times is kept
	This cuts down on the number of diffs, greatly speeding things up.
