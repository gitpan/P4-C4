* Changes in P4::C4 2.030 8/30/2004

***	Detect c4 style clients, and on non-c4 clients allow sync/sumbit.
	Also allow raw p4 sync or submit with new -p4 flag.
	This allows c4 to be used as a full replacement for p4, even
	when the additional management features aren't desired.

****	Support new 2003.02 commands

****	Fix processing of filenames with embeded spaces. [Greg Waters]

**	First CPAN Release

**	Changes relative to C4-1.6 C program by Neil Russell

***	The .c4 file is now named .p4config
	as the p4 program knows how to use a .p4config file.

***	The .c4ignore file is now named .cvsignore
	to allow direct importing/exporting to/from CVS.

***	Multiple and single-file arguments allowed with the update command.

***	Client-create command added.

***	The API is used, rather then calling p4
	This improves the speed of the program.

***	A cache of file modification times is kept
	This cuts down on the number of diffs, greatly speeding things up.
