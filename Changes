* P4::C4 2.041 5/3/2004

**	NEWS is now renamed Changes, to support CPAN indexing.

****    Fixed adding deleted files back when using update -a.  [by David Rees]

* P4::C4 2.040 11/9/2004

***	Added 'c4 update/unknown -pi' to print those files which are
	unknown, but suppressed with a .cvsignore file.  [David Rees]

***	Added 'c4 update -rl' to remove lost files. [David Rees]
	If you use the parameter then all lost files are "p4 deleted" in
	the client, and thus combination of -a and -rl essentially says
	"make perforce like my local".

***	Added 'c4 update -a' to add unknown files.  [David Rees]

***	Added support for CVSIGNORE, "~/.cvsignore", and !. [David Rees]
	These add additional compatibility with CVS's ignore rules.

****	Added "due to {filename}" to "Must update again." [David Rees]

****	Fixed performance problem when updating subdirs. [David Rees]

* P4::C4 2.032 10/15/2004

***	Added 'c4 change-max'.  [Rajesh Vaidheeswarran]

***	Added 'c4 unknown -a' to add files. [David Rees]

* P4::C4 2.031 9/14/2004

***	Added 'c4 help-summary'

****	Fix filenames to support case-independence on Windows. [David Rees]

* P4::C4 2.030 8/30/2004

***	Detect c4 style clients, and on non-c4 clients allow sync/sumbit.
	Also allow raw p4 sync or submit with new -p4 flag.
	This allows c4 to be used as a full replacement for p4, even
	when the additional management features aren't desired.

****	Support new 2003.02 commands

****	Fix processing of filenames with embeded spaces. [Greg Waters]

* P4::C4 2.021 1/27/2004

****	Documentation fixes.

* P4::C4 2.020 8/6/2003

**	Added "c4 unknown" command.

***	Fixed "c4 client-delete" when the client dir no longer exists.

* P4::C4 2.010 3/18/2003

**	Added "c4 client-delete" command.

**	Added "c4_job_edit" shell command.

***	Add P4USER to .p4config file.  Thus if another user updates
	the client, it will be under the correct owner of the area.

***	c4 submit now has -f flag for suppressing up-to-date check.

****	Fix bug with haveRev not set if file created during update

* P4::C4 2.000 8/08/2002

**	First CPAN Release

**	Changes relative to C4-1.6 C program by Neil Russell

***	The .c4 file is now named .p4config
	as the p4 program knows how to use a .p4config file.

***	The .c4ignore file is now named .cvsignore
	to allow direct importing/exporting to/from CVS.

***	Multiple and single-file arguments allowed with the update command.

***	Client-create command added.

***	The API is used, rather then calling p4
	This improves the speed of the program.

***	A cache of file modification times is kept
	This cuts down on the number of diffs, greatly speeding things up.
