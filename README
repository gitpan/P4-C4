1.4 Supported Systems
=====================

This version of P4::C4 has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any Unix system with Perforce, provided that the
required perl modules below are ported to the platform.  Minor porting
may be required for Windows systems.

1.5 Installation
================

  1.  Before installing this module, you need the Perforce Perl library,
     P4::Client, available from CPAN or www.perforce.com.  This in turn
     requires the Perforce API, also available from www.perforce.com.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing this README notice.

  3. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure P4::C4 for your system.

  4. Type `make' to compile P4::C4.

  5. Type `make test' to check the compilation.  You will need a P4
     deamon running.  It will NOT change the repository.

  6. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  7. Type `c4 help' to see the command line interface.


1.6 Differences from C4-1.6
===========================

This C4 package is based upon c4-1.6 written in C by Neil Russell in
1999.  It has the same basic operations, with several minor differences.
For these differences, see the bottom of the Changes file in the same
directory as this readme.
